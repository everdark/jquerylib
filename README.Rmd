# jquerylib

Obtain 'jQuery' as an HTML dependency object

## Installation

**jquerylib** isn't yet available from CRAN, but you can install it with:

```r
remotes::install_github("rstudio/jquerylib")
```

## Usage

The **jquerylib** package currently has one function,`jquery_core()`, which returns a `htmltools::htmlDependency()` object that [bundles a stable version of jQuery Core](https://code.jquery.com/). Here we use it to obtain jQuery 3.x, but currently 2.x and 1.x are also supported. You likely won't need to use this package directly, but packages like **shiny** and **rmarkdown** will eventually use this package to avoid bundling redundant copies jQuery.

```{r}
jquerylib::jquery_core(3)
```
